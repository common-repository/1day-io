When making a booking, redirecting your customers to an external site creates friction in the user experience. The guest would be left wondering: “Am I still on the same website? Maybe I will just book through the OTA instead.”

With the 1Day Booking Engine, the customer never leaves your hotel’s website, nor mess around with confusing pop-ups. So they can complete their booking with confidence and ease.

The booking engine is fully integrated with the [1Day Property Management System](https://1day.io/) to easily manage inventory and rates (The free plan is enough). See and manage all the bookings in an intuitive calendar and take advantage of 1Day’s advanced features.

The plugin is fully integrated with WooCommerce, the world’s most popular e-commerce platform. This means you can take advantage of countless payment gateways around the world. Including countryspecific ones that may not be available elsewhere.

Paid plans include more features such as integrations with a channel manager to synchronize availability with online travel agencies, and many more.
